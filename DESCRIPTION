Description: Diverse spatial datasets for demonstrating, benchmarking and teaching spatial data analysis. 
It includes R data of class sf, Spatial, and nb.
Unlike other spatial data packages such as rnaturalearth and maps, 
it also contains data stored in a range of file formats including GeoJSON, ESRI Shapefile and GeoPackage. 
Some of the datasets are designed to illustrate specific analysis techniques.
cycle_hire and cycle_hire_osm, for example, are designed to illustrate point pattern analysis techniques.
