\description{
  Mercer and Hall wheat yield data, based on version in Cressie (1993), p. 455.
}
\usage{data(wheat)}
\format{
  The format of the object generated by running \code{data(wheat)} is a three column data frame made available by Hongfei Li. The example section shows how to convert this to the object used in demonstrating the \code{aple} function, and is a:
Formal class 'SpatialPolygonsDataFrame' [package "sp"] with 5 slots;
  the data slot is a data frame with 500 observations on the following 6 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{lat}}{local coordinates northings ordered north to south}
    \item{\code{yield}}{Mercer and Hall wheat yield data}
    \item{\code{r}}{rows south to north; levels in distance units of plot centres}
    \item{\code{c}}{columns west to east; levels in distance units of plot centres}
    \item{\code{lon}}{local coordinates eastings}
    \item{\code{lat1}}{local coordinates northings ordered south to north}
}}
