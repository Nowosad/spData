\title{Marshall's infant mortality in Auckland dataset}
\usage{data(auckland)}
\description{
(Use \code{example(auckland)} to load the data from shapefile and generate neighbour list on the fly).

The \code{auckland} data frame has 167 rows (census area units --- CAU) and 4 columns. The dataset also includes the "nb" object \code{auckland.nb} of neighbour relations based on contiguity, and the "polylist" object \code{auckpolys} of polygon boundaries for the CAU. The \code{auckland} data frame includes the following columns:
}
\format{
  This data frame contains the following columns:
  \describe{
    \item{Easting}{a numeric vector of x coordinates in an unknown spatial reference system}
    \item{Northing}{a numeric vector of y coordinates in an unknown spatial reference system}
    \item{M77\_85}{a numeric vector of counts of infant (under 5 years of age) deaths in Auckland, 1977-1985}
    \item{Und5\_81}{a numeric vector of population under 5 years of age at the 1981 Census}
  }
}
\details{
 The contiguous neighbours object does not completely replicate results in the sources, and was reconstructed from \code{auckpolys}; examination of figures in the sources suggests that there are differences in detail, although probably not in substance.
